### Other internal feedback (Mitch):

- ✓ 00:00  Leave a beat on the teal frame prior to commencement of animation
- ✓ 00:00  music needs a fade in
- ✓ 00:40  highlight on 3,500 hampers slightly off
- ✓ 01:22  flicker on screen (?) unsure of what this represents
	
	> I agree this is a bit strange, but it was asked for in the storyboards (frame 28). I’ve moved the flash back to when you can see the monitor so hopefully this is more clear now.
	
- ✓ 01:34  scale in on non-vector tree makes it pixelated. To fix.
- ✓ 01:39  tone down the blur on phones in background a bit, makes them look a look too low quality/pixelated
- ✓ 01:54  scale in on non-vector people icon makes it pixelated. To fix.
- ✓ 02:01  shaper layer of globe flickers in and out twice. Check layers.
- ✓ 02:10  scale in on non-vector ribbon icon makes it pixelated. To fix.
- ✓ 02:19  'that's why we invested...' line may need to stay on screen for slightly longer. GFX draw a lot of attention on this part so and extra half second or less may be good.
- ✓ 02:21  ' 97.3% of the...' line is a single sentence. Keep it on slightly longer to stop the lead on to the next line from feeling like and extra line isn't continuing on from this frame.
- ✓ 02:33  check highlight end on socially minded
- ✓ 02:52  have everything continue to scale down/zoom out to allow the yes to animate in. Then animate off to reveal Optus logo than straight cut.
- ✓ 02:57  music fade out.
